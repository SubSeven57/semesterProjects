        <h3 class="abt_h0">The Project: What is SkyLane?</h3>
        <p class="abt_0">I'm glad you asked! SkyLane is a website dedicated to showing the great parts of the city of Chicago. Fairly often, websites that dedicate themselves to showing off cities only focus of super trendy places. Which is good, but not good enough for Chicago. This city is know for its diversity and that's exactly what I wanted to show off.</p>

        <h3 class="abt_h1">Who Are You? ðŸ¤”</h3>
        <p class="abt_p1">Hello there! My name is Daniel Hernandez and I am currently a student of Software Engineering. I've been doing web development for over 8 years now. My "career" started off in the MySpace era, back when profile layouts where the hot thing to have. I began tweaking existing ones and then creating my own variations. Next thing I know, I'm making writing net-code for a game my friend and I wrote in PHP. Mark-up languages are gateway drugs, man. It's a rabbit hole that I never wish to ascend from.</p>
        <h3 class="abt_h2">What Do You Know?</h3>
        <p class="abt_p2">Like any good developer, I try to maintain a certain bank of knowledge. However, my main focus is web development. This is mainly due to the fact that it is mainly operating system-agnostic. My skill portafolio consists of:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Python and related frameworks (Django, Flask)</li>
            <li>A metric ton of JS frameworks</li>
            <li>Ruby On Rails (at my friend's recommendation).</li>
          </ul>
          Aside from this, I also specialize in working with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free, Libre, and Open Source software (FLOSS) </a>. I am a huge advocate and user of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html">GNU/Linux infrastructure</a>.
